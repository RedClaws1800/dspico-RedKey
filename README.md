## 🧰 DSpico Shell

The CAD design of the shell is located in the [`dspico-shell`](dspico-shell) folder. This folder contains 3D models of the shell (output 3d models and design files), which can be viewed and modified using CAD design software Autodesk Inventor

![DSpico-shell-in](dspico-artwork-design/photos/shell-in.png)

### 📂 Included Subfolders:
- [`design-files`](dspico-shell/design-files): Contains source design files for the shell
- [`3d-models`](dspico-shell/3d-models): Contains 3D models of the shell in STL and STEP format for fabrication.

## 🎨 Artwork: Stickers and box art
The stickers and box art design are located in the [`dspico-artwork-design`](dspico-artwork-design).  This folder contains stickers for cartridge and box art in SVG, PSD and PNG formats.

## 📦 Instructions
### 1️⃣ Build
1. **Manufacture the PCB and Shell**<br>
    Start by producing both the PCB and the shell. Go to the respective sections, [`dspico-pcb`](dspico-pcb) and [`dspico-shell`](dspico-shell), and read the README file in each to understand how to create these parts.

2. **Optional: Customize with a Sticker and Box Art**<br>
    If desired, you can print a sticker from the stickers section and add box art [`dspico-artwork-design`](dspico-artwork-design) for storing your DSpico (for example, by reusing an existing box).

### 2️⃣ Assembly
Once you have both the PCB and the shell manufactured, the next step is to assemble them. Follow these steps:
1. First, insert the PCB into the bottom part of the shell.
2. Next, attach the top part of the shell by aligning the pegs with the holes in the bottom part.
3. Stick your favorite DSpico sticker on top part.
Make sure everything fits, and your DSpico will be ready for the next steps!

### 3️⃣ Setup the software
Follow the [guide](https://github.com/LNH-team/dspico/blob/develop/GUIDE.md) for instructions on how to compile and setup the firmware and the contents of the micro SD card.

## 🛠 Development
The DSpico features a development port for creating new applications and developing new peripherals. The available communication ports are as follows:
- UART
- I2C
- x2 GPIO
- SWD (debug)

![development port](dspico-artwork-design/others/dev-port-pinout.png)

As for the power it can provide to peripherals, it is:
- 3.3 V (up to 50 mA)

The pitch between pins of this port is 2.54 mm such that some connectors can be soldered (as long as it does not interfere with the rest of the DSpico mechanics). For example a male or female header.
